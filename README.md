gulp-react
==========

Simple skeleton for an npm-based project setup for React projects based on gulp, browserify and reactify.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need nodejs ( http://nodejs.org/ ). Make sure to execute "npm update" to download all npm dependencies
after checking this out.

Building
--------

use "gulp" to just build, and "gulp watch" to enable streaming build.

More Modern Alternative
-----------------------

I recently also set up an updated version of this. https://github.com/fforw/b6-react-template
